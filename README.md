Lifevault - Your Easy Online Journal & Planner
================

I made this because ohlife shut down and there was nothing good to replace it.
I intend it to be my gift to the world, completely free if at all possible.

Signup for lifevault and you'll get an email every day asking you what you've been
up to. You reply to the email and it's saved.

You can browse your journal anytime online.

When we send you your daily email, we'll include a random "once month ago you wrote" line.

I give my word that I will never read your journal entries or hand them over to any third party.

The database is secure and encrypted at rest.

I hope this catches on!
